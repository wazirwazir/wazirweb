		<p>Greater Bamboo Lemurs are some of the most endangered animals in the world. They were thought to be extinct until scientists rediscovered a small population of the species in 1986. They have the smallest Lemur population, with only about 100 documented individuals. As their name suggests, they eat mostly bamboos, and they are found in Madagascarâ€™s rainforest</p><br>

		<img src="https://netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/464b985db62fa189.jpg?imwidth=360">
		<p>Pangolins are solitary, nocturnal creatures with scales covering their bodies and long sticky tongues to slurp up food. They are about the size of a house cat and look a little bit like artichokes on legs. When threatened, they defend themselves by rolling up into a ball. Pangolins are found in Asia and Africa. They are endangered because they are increasingly victims of wildlife crime for their meat and scales. They are believed to be the most trafficked mammal in the world.</p><br>
